### Useful tools
#### setuptools (easy_install)  
setuptools -> distribute -> setuptools  
[What is the difference?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6344076/differences-between-distribute-distutils-setuptools-and-distutils2/6522905#6522905)  
  
#### easy_install (part of setuptools)-> pip

[An Easy Guide to Install Python or Pip on Windows](http://arunrocks.com/guide-to-install-python-or-pip-on-windows/)  
pip can uninstall  
But... easy_install works better on windows because it handles binaries.  
  
### Another option  
[pip for windows](https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/python/pip-for-windows)

Why use other options?  
  
##Scope  
Namespace, including __main__  
  
###[Scope Hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html) (9.2 Only)  
1.the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
2. the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names
3. the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
4. the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in namesthe innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names

###The namespace script
```
a = 0
def myName():
    print "When called by a function in my namespace, my name is", __name__
def whatisa():
    a = 1
    print a
def whatisglobala():
    global a
    print a
print "Right now, my name is:", __name__
```
