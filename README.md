# Introductory Geoprocessing with Python

This course will get you up and running with python in four sections. We still
start with installation, including installation with ArcGIS, integrated
development environments (IDEs) and where to find more help. Next, we will
cover basic syntax, import statements, writing functions, and adding
additional libraries and site packages to your installation. For the third
section of the class, we will dive into python programming basics: variables,
scopes, datatypes, flow control, debugging, and error handling. The class will
wrap up by covering common data structures and an introduction to libraries
with the widely used os and datetime modules. You should have a very basic
understanding of script writing, as we will be up and running with our own
scripts by the end of the class. Knowledge of basic flow control (if-then-
else, for loops, while loops) is recommended.
